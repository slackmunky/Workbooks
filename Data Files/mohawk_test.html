It\u2019s part vampiric fantasy, part fever dream; the kind of sound that will push the envelope in the Austin music scene. When lead singer Jeb Bunting\u2019s enthralling vocals, reminiscent of Jim Morrison, combine with Alden Sayre\u2019s dynamic guitar presence, ominous synthesizer sounds, and use of low frequency oscillation the result is a dark hedonic thrill. With reverberations resembling Ghostland Observatory, Halloween Party offers a thrilling distinction.The unmistakable chemistry between Jeb and Alden is no coincidence; the duo has been making music together since they met in high school. Over the years they have culminated their sound which has undoubtedly progressed to the inception of Halloween Party.The duo is capturing the essence of Halloween in its entirety with lyrics and tones that instantly elicit an images of old horror films. With synth layers that give off a party vibe, it creates a perfect storm that is \u201cspook pop.\u201d\u00a0Their latest singles Lullaby and Big Buried Soul exemplify the depth of Jeb and Alden\u2019s artistic prowess. Each song takes you to either side of their frightful spectrum. Big Buried Soul taps into the energetic side, a rhythmic and danceable tune that still leaves traces of obscurity. Lullaby is a more chaotic ballad which combines a similar energy but with eerie lyrics and an enthralling hook.\u00a0After hearing some unreleased tracks, and learning of upcoming performances, it\u2019s clear the pair will be making an explosive appearance in the Austin scene. Expect these spooky boys to exceed expectations and make a lasting mark with their genre defying sound.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/south-by-spook-west-mohawk-indoor-tickets-95659071859","validFrom":"2020-02-21T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Halloween Party"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Animals on TV"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Me Nd Adam"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Music of The Beatles for Kids @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F92547969%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200214-161904?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=964026ceb731bd6f881909a12c649be4","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/music-of-the-beatles-for-kids-mohawk-94223403737\/","startDate":"2020-03-08T11:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00","endDate":"2020-03-09T06:00:00-05:00","description":"The Rock and Roll Playhouse, a family concert series hosted at historic music venues across the country, allows kids to \u201cmove, play and sing while listening to works from the classic-rock canon\u201d (NY Times).

There was also Wendy Nelson (keyboards, sampling) who joined the band in the end of their career and who was a long time friend of theirs.The public was always enthusiastic to the live shows of The Skatenigs what\u2019s yet another proof for its characteristic sound mixing punk, rock, rap and metal styles with a little bit of industrial as well.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"0.00","highPrice":"0.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/skatenigs-mohawk-indoor-tickets-90725896599","validFrom":"2020-01-21T00:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Skatenigs"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Paulie Think"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Worm Suicide"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Otis the Destroyer @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F94485589%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200227-191431?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=8cca3a512a7b25aa1efa865eece0e1ea","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/otis-the-destroyer-mohawk-indoor--96205957609\/","startDate":"2020-03-08T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00","endDate":"2020-03-09T06:00:00-05:00","description":"OFFICIAL RE-LAUNCH PARTY FOR SHOWLISTAUSTIN.COM!!Welcome back Showlist Austin to the scene with a lineup of stellar music acts on the indoor Mohawk stage!featuringOtis the DestroyerThe Western CivilizationBooher---Showlist Austin is your straightforward guide to live music in Austin, Texas.

Friends and work colleagues have described them as &quot;actually pretty good&quot; and &quot;better than I expected&quot; while promising that despite the recent string of obligatory grandparent birthday celebrations, they&#039;d definitely come to the next show. The songwriting core started in the summer of 2015 as a mix of co-workers and mutual acquaintances. Blending punk, blues, and psych-rock influences, the fledgling band soon found themselves where most bands unfortunately find themselves- on Craigslist, seeking drums and bass. Netting lukewarm and confusing results on Tinder, the band found solace in the words of Nicholas Sparks, &quot;Love is like the wind, you can&#039;t see it, but you can feel it.In the winter of 2016, The Banisters felt it. They successfully filled out their rhythm section and began playing shows all around Austin. They\u2019ve since been invited to play with bands in Houston, San Antonio, San Marcos, the DFW area, and Oklahoma. Their energetic performances and irresistible rock jams have brought them to various festivals including SXSW and Deep Ellum Arts Fest. The band has been featured on KUTX&#039;s Song of the Day and was recently awarded The Deli Magazine\u2019s Austin Emerging Artist of the Month.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-banisters-4th-anniversary-show-mohawk-indoor-tickets-91641703803","validFrom":"2020-01-29T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"The Banisters"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Fertility House"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Cheap Wave"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"The Warning @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F84000785%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191209-174238?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=4531eb14cf3a9a88a5b52047e441a464","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/the-warning-mohawk-indoor--83366662933\/","startDate":"2020-03-25T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-26T06:00:00-05:00","description":"This impressive trio of sisters - Daniela (guitar and voice), Paulina (drums, piano and vocals), and Alejandra (bass, piano and vocals), have elaborate musical affinities that range from the classic rock of Queen and Pink Floyd, to sounds from more recent generations like Muse and My Chemical Romance.

I had just dropped out of college (not the first time I had dropped out of school) and was living back in my home state of California, with no fucking idea what my life was about to become. Everyday I would write a song or two about the angst, confusion, anxiety, and existential dread I felt as an early 20-something college drop out. I would sit in that little room, on a mattress on the floor, and have what felt to me like a therapy session with my guitar and a notepad. I started sending these songs to my friend Bobb Bruno, who I\u2019d known since I was 17, and he started sprinkling his parts on top of them.\u00a0I really wish I could explain Best Coast\u2019s story in a more profound way, but in all honesty, I can\u2019t\u2014because I remember so little of it. Before I knew it, we were a band with a record deal touring the world, playing on late night TV, signing peoples LP sleeves, and doing music videos with Drew Barrymore. The majority of the time that my band was taking off, I was stuck in a dark daze. My romantic relationship was a topic of conversation, my cat was asked about in interviews, my drug and alcohol abuse was on public display. Everyday was like Groundhog\u2019s Day\u2014I was repeating the same self-destructive patterns day in an day out.\u00a0We played Lollapooloza in 2011 and I literally started the set by flipping someone off in the crowd and saying, \u201cFuck you, we\u2019re Best Coast.\u201d I didn\u2019t do that because I was some badass Joan Jett rock star. I did that because I was deeply miserable and deeply insecure about what you thought of me so I wanted you to see me as someone who didn\u2019t give a fuck.\u00a0After we finished the album cycle for California Nights, something terrifying happened to me. I felt creatively paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t write music. For the first time in my entire life, I had nothing to say. There was so much bubbling inside of me, so many things happening, so much to process,\u00a0 but I couldn\u2019t get any of it out. I didn\u2019t leave my house. I drank wine alone on my couch. I watched every season of Vanderpump Rules available on Hulu. Trump had won the election. I was miserable and nothing was ever going to change. One day, I locked myself in my closet and I forced myself to write. It was the first time in years I was able to get something out. And out came \u201cEverything Has Changed.\u201d The song was like a vision of life I wished I was living. A life in which things didn\u2019t look so foggy. A life in which I didn\u2019t drink anymore. It wasn\u2019t the life I was living. Not yet. But that song was prophetic. It described the life I would soon be living.\u00a0I guess it\u2019s no secret that I was a bit of a \u201cparty girl\u201d in the early stages of Best Coast. My life went from college drop-out to Billboard-charting indie musician in a very short period of time. No one teaches you how to handle success or failure. I had zero coping skills. I turned to the only help I could think of, numbing the problems and the pain away. And it worked, until it didn\u2019t. On November 12, 2017, I decided that enough was enough and made the decision to get sober. It\u2019s been hard, it\u2019s been beautiful, it\u2019s been scary\u2014and something I\u2019m proud of. I can\u2019t tell the story of this album without mentioning my sobriety, because it\u2019s a huge part of this story.Always Tomorrow is the story of where I was and where I am now. As well as the struggles I am still learning to identify and figure out because lets face it, life is fucking hard, and like I said before, there is no guidebook.\u00a0 Some days I wake up and I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world and I forget about everything that\u2019s ever bummed me out, and other days, it all comes flooding back. This album is about leaving the darkness for the light, but still understanding that nothing is ever going to be perfect. It\u2019s an album about attempting to fix your broken patterns and learning to get out of your own way. It\u2019s about burning it all down and starting from scratch even when the idea of that is fucking terrifying. Closing one chapter and moving onto the next even when you have no idea what is on the other side. Acceptance. It\u2019s about taking a gigantic leap of faith.\u00a0I hope this record helps people. It\u2019s easier to stay comfortable in the insanity, but for me, there just came a time where I had to get off the ride. I had to look at life and ask, Why am I still doing this? I was writing the same song over and over again: I\u2019m miserable!\u00a0 But I wasn\u2019t doing much to change that. I still fail at times, but I\u2019m less afraid of failing than ever before. This record is the story of a second chance.\u00a0","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"25.00","highPrice":"25.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/best-coast-mohawk-tickets-71460836285","validFrom":"2019-11-08T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Best Coast"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Mannequin Pussy"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Austin Plaine &amp; Anthony da Costa @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F81172639%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191114-204637?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=7fc2fbec9d839a95a6facdc005ef48f5","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/austin-plaine-anthony-da-costa-mohawk-indoor--78197054495\/","startDate":"2020-03-28T21:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-28T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-29T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Like only the most insightful songwriters, Austin Plaine draws intense emotion from the subtlest moments. On his sophomore album Stratford, the Minnesota-bred, Nashville based musician shapes his lyrical storytelling with both precision and pure feeling, capturing every nuance of lost love and longing and fractured innocence. And while Stratford is steeped in a warm nostalgia, Plaine instills each song with a quiet optimism that speaks to bravely moving forward, even in troubled times.Produced by Jay Foote and mixed by Steve Vealey (M. Ward, Phoenix, Hurray for the Riff Raff) at the legendary Electric Lady Studios, Stratford arrives as the follow-up to Plaine\u2019s self-titled debut\u2014a 2015 release that earned comparisons to Bob Dylan and Conor Oberst from Baeble Music. In a departure from that more stripped-down effort, Plaine assembled a full-fledged band who recorded in an apartment in Brooklyn, infusing Stratford with a homegrown feel and loose yet kinetic energy.Taking its title from the Flatbush street where the album came to life, Stratford offers a classically arranged take on folk-rock that illuminates the intimacy of Plaine\u2019s vocal work and the graceful candor of his lyrics. From track to track, the 27-year-old singer\/guitarist reveals a refined sense of songcraft that he partly credits to moving to Nashville from his hometown of Minneapolis in early 2017. \u201cBeing part of a whole community of songwriters, you realize there\u2019s a lot of different directions you can take a song,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really opened me up as a writer, and it\u2019s also helped me to hone in on every word of every line that I write.\u201dAnthony da Costa is no stranger to the music world. At age 13 he started writing songs and playing out anywhere he could, and his career as a singer\/songwriter never really stopped. In the last decade, he\u2019s lived in New York City, Austin, TX and most recently, Nashville, TN, all of which have shaped him as a musician and led to countless opportunities and collaborations.da Costa has released many albums over the course of his career, most recently a solo LP (da Costa) and a collaboration with Adam Levy (Neighbors) in 2017, and an EP (Shadow Love) in 2019. For the last several years, he\u2019s also been consistently touring, sharing bills with bands such as Big Thief, The Milk Carton Kids, and Loretta Lynn, and sharing stages with Joy Williams (The Civil Wars), Sarah Jarosz, Molly Tuttle, and Yola, just to name a few.During his time as a sideman, da Costa\u2019s desire to write and release songs of his own remained steady. Last year he met up with long-time friend and producer Kenneth Pattengale (The Milk Carton Kids), and made what will be his next solo record, called Feet on the Dashboard, and in da Costa\u2019s words, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d A culmination of a sound developed since he was a teenager, Feet on the Dashboard is a collection of songs set to be a deliberate reintroduction to who da Costa is, and who he has always been: an earnest songwriter and an artist on his own merit.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"10.00","highPrice":"13.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/austin-plaine-anthony-da-costa-mohawk-indoor-tickets-78197054495","validFrom":"2019-11-15T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Austin Plaine"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Anthony da Costa"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Pears @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F88848831%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200122-171500?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=ee6e57ecde7d7289f2d4d353708d08eb","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/pears-mohawk-indoor--84631500095\/","startDate":"2020-03-29T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-29T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-30T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"13.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/pears-mohawk-indoor-tickets-84631500095","validFrom":"2020-01-24T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Pears"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Single Mothers"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Noogy"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Circle Pit @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F87471171%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200113-202541?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=1ea39545efae6bf8fa0681d51ca84b71","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/circle-pit-mohawk-indoor--86055800215\/","startDate":"2020-03-31T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-31T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-01T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/circle-pit-mohawk-indoor-tickets-86055800215","validFrom":"2020-01-15T11:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Circle Pit"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Zero Percent"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Hellfury"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Bondbreakr"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Josh Kelley @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F83996839%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191209-171410?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=d2f8feca7171ae534543302da8a234e1","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/josh-kelley-mohawk-indoor--83866034567\/","startDate":"2020-04-01T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-01T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-02T06:00:00-05:00","description":"\u201cIn a door frame of this lived-in home there is a pen hanging from a string, there lies the tale of a husband and a wife steady growing up their family,\u201c singer-songwriter Josh Kelley sings on \u201cBusy Making Memories,\u201d a deeply personal excerpt from his new album, I Sing.

Watching my kids grow up is just amazing and inspiring.\u201d Josh creates most of his music in a barn on his property that he\u2019s converted into a studio. He produced and engineered the entirety of his new project himself; he\u2019s been self-producing music since he was 15-years-old, and really dug into engineering and mixing when he moved to Los Angeles in 2002. He also plays 15 different instruments.\u201cMy recording process has changed over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to start a song and then begin the production process before the song was even finished. Now that I\u2019m older I\u2019ve changed my ways, and I make sure all of the structure, tempo, and lyrics are perfect. Then I drive over to my studio and try to wrap my head around how the song should live in people\u2019s ears. It\u2019s better for me to finish the song musically and lyrically before ever turning anything else on.\u201dOn I Sing, Kelley solidifies himself as a talented vocalist and lyricist while tapping into the details of an everyday family. He\u2019s watching his kids develop their own personalities and continuing to find new reasons to love his wife after close to 15 years together. He\u2019s missing it all when he\u2019s away from them. He says, outside of his family, the one other constant in his daily life is singing.Writing I Sing began with \u201cLove Her Boy,\u201d a smooth and soulful number that finds Josh delving into different uses for the phrase. He started experimenting with wordplay, which carries throughout the album.\u201cI was trying to write a totally different song on a plane back home from a Colorado festival,\u201d he says, explaining that he wrote the title down and filed it away for a writing session he had the next day. \u201cI brought the idea of \u2018love her boy\u2019 to the session. The different uses within the song create an oronym, two phrases that sound the same but mean different things. I think it\u2019s a clever angle, and we had so much fun bringing it to life.\u201d\u201cWe Don\u2019t Need The Money\u201d finds Josh and co-writer Eric Kertes reversing their usual roles to create a funky groove; \u201cBack To You\u201d begs for a sing-along; \u201cIf That\u2019s Alright\u201d continues the theme. \u201cYou Can Count On Me,\u201d with a cameo on background vocals from his daughters, takes its sonic inspiration from Bill Withers and Shuggie Otis. It was written with Alen Chang. \u201cI was only a melody man and co-lyricist -- we talked about people in our lives that needed our support and what we would say to them if we were brave enough to say it,\u201d Josh says. \u201cI showed up to Alen\u2019s house, and after describing the concept, he had the idea in his head within minutes. On this rare occasion, I was only a melody man and co-lyricist. The song was done by dinner time.\u201d\u201cYou And I,\u201d written with Nashville songwriter Dustin Christensen, slows things down with an ode to an all-consuming kind of love. \u201cI can\u02bct imagine my life without my person because we have created this safe place that is sometimes almost unbearable to leave,\u201d Josh says. \u201cI Want You Tonight,\u201d \u201cBecause I Love You\u201d and \u201cLoves You Like Me\u201d are straight-up love songs. \u201cI\u02bcm a sucker for these and I\u02bcll keep writing them till the day I float away,\u201d Josh says.Growing up in Augusta, Georgia, Josh absorbed R&amp;B, soul, and vintage country, while also developing an affinity for classic rock. His musical family would often sit around their piano creating songs. When he was 12, his older brother accidentally left his guitar at home when he headed back to college -- a month later, he was covering Led Zeppelin songs. The rest is history.\u201cMy sister\u2019s husband, Kris, taught me different scales on the guitar and introduced me to Stevie Ray Vaughan,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mind on playing the blues for many years because of him. I learned from many of these songs that simple musical progressions lent room for more complicated and beautiful melodies.\u201dDuring their early teens, Josh and his younger brother Charles (now one-third of Lady Antebellum) formed a band, Inside Blue, whose self-released album gained local radio airplay and caught the attention of soul legend James Brown. Josh released his solo debut, Changing Faces, while attending the University of Mississippi. He then signed a record deal with Hollywood Records, which released his 2003 mainstream debut For the Ride Home. He found a Top Five single with \u201cAmazing,\u201d and his second album Almost Honest, included the Top Ten single \u201cOnly You.\u201dJosh later released four independent albums \u2014 Just Say the Word, Special Company, Backwoods and To Remember \u2014 between 2006 and 2008. He released Georgia Clay in 2011 with MCA Nashville, and 2015\u2019s New Lane Road with Sugar Hill Records. In 2017 he independently released an album of covers, titledUnder the Covers, Vol. 1, and a holiday album, Christmas Traditions. He has appeared on \u201cThe Ellen Degeneres Show,\u201d \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\u201d \u201cLive with Regis &amp; Kelly\u201d and \u201cLast Call with Carson Daly,\u201d and his songs have been featured on such shows as \u201cSmallville,\u201d \u201cScrubs,\u201d \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d and MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Hills.\u201d Josh also wrote and performed the theme song for the TV sitcom \u201cMike and Molly,\u201d scored the feature film Home Sweet Hell, and created the theme song for TV\u2019s Golf Channel.\u201cI will never stop creating music \u2013 it is in my blood and it is what I was put on this earth to do,\u201d he says. Josh Kelley launched his artist career in 2001 out of his college dorm room that propelled him into the industry with his hit song \u201cAmazing\u201d. It was the most played song of the year on pop radio and topped the charts at number 5. Since then Josh has toured with some of music\u2019s biggest names including Taylor Swift, Dave Matthews Band, and Lady Antebellum. Josh has been in his studio for the past two years developing new music and his new record set to release in June of 2020. All of the songs to be released on the project were written by Josh and he also 2020 plans also include a US Spring tour to be followed by a 3 week European tour in the fall. The next chapter of Josh Kelley will be a further testament of the artist and songwriter he truly is.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/josh-kelley-mohawk-indoor-tickets-83866034567","validFrom":"2019-12-13T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Los Amigos Invisibles &amp; Aterciopelados @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F81945539%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191119-220717?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=568355819b3d6bfdd43415c965268fee","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/los-amigos-invisibles-aterciopelados-mohawk-74339273769\/","startDate":"2020-04-02T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-02T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-03T06:00:00-05:00","description":"The band\u00b4s name comes from the television show \u201cHuman Values\u201d by Venezuelan historian Arturo Uslar Pietri, which remained in the air for two decades, where he always dedicated the show to his \u201cInvisible Friends\u201d refering to the audience.His record debut came in 1995 with the release of \u201cA Typical and Autoctonal Venezuelan Dance Band\u201d. Little by little, the band consolidated its local fame by staying on tour until 1996.It is in this year that David Byrne, while shopping at a record store in New York, accidentally finds one of the copies left by Los Amigos on consignment and immediately begins the process of conversations that led to signing them for his record label \u201cLuaka Bop\u201d. After months of conversations, pre-production and production, in 1998 they released their first album for the label of the former Talking Heads, \u201cThe New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera\u201d, produced by Andr\u00e9s Lev\u00edn, which had hits like \u201cPonerte en Cuatro\u201d, \u201cSexy\u201d and \u201cDisco Anal\u201d.Two years later the band moves to the city of San Francisco for 2 months to record their next album and it is at this time that the band is considering the possibility of moving permanently to the United States to continue their career.At the end of 2000 they put on sale their third album \u201cArepa 3000: A Venezuelan Journey Into Space\u201d produced by Phillip Steir which is nominated for a Grammy Award and a Latin Grammy. Of this disc they leave subjects like \u201cCuchi Cuchi\u201d and \u201cThe Neighbor\u201d.After almost a year of planning, the band decided to move to New York City on January 23, 2001. During their first year in the city, Los Amigos began a friendly and working relationship with the legends of the dance world \u201cMasters At Work\u201d which leads them to enter the studio in early 2002 to record what would be their fourth album.\u201cThe Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1\u201d produced by Masters At Work, is published in Venezuela in 2003 and in the United States in 2004 and that same year they are nominated for a Latin Grammy in the category of Best Alternative Latin Album. Being their most mature album according to the criterion of many fans, Los Amigos achieve an impeccable and unique sound and include songs of more than 8 minutes with long instrumental sections, remembering the great recordings that were made in the 70s and 80s.In 2006, Los Amigos Invisibles ended their contract with the Luaka Bop label and independently edited their album \u201cSuperpop Venezuela\u201d. This album is a collection of Venezuelan songs from the 60s, 70s and 80s. This album is nominated for a Grammy in the category \u201cBest Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album\u201d. This would be their 2nd nomination to the American Grammys.In 2008 they released their first album and live DVD called \u201cEn una noche tan linda como esta\u201d and began the process of recording their 6th studio album.\u201cComercial\u201d (Eng: \u201cCommercial\u201d) goes on sale in 2009 and Los Amigos Invisibles is nominated for its 3rd Latin Grammy.

To achieve this concept, the Venezuelan band used new instruments and invited important musicians from the Latin American music scene to participate. Natalia Lafourcade, Alex Syntek, Jay de la Cueva (Moderatto), Venezuelan Mariana Vega, Gil Cerezo (Kinky), a Brazilian percussion group and a string quartet. Los Amigos Invisibles closed 2015 with more than 50 concerts in 10 different countries.In 2016, accompanied by artists of the likes of Carlos Vives, Santiago Cruz, Franco de Vita, Kany Garcia and Ricardo Montaner, Los Amigos Invisibles lead a record production directed by Sony US\/Latin to honor one of the greats of music: Yordano Los Amigos Invisibles lead this record material entitled \u201cEl Tren de los Regresos\u201d.On October 14, 2016 Los Amigos Invisibles published on all the platforms \u201cDame El Mambo\u201d, the first single from their most recent album \u201cEl Paradise\u201d, which came to light at the beginning of 2017.

It features the participation of big names, such as Macaco, Le\u00f3n Larregui (vocals for the Mexican group Zo\u00e9), Goyo (Chocquibtown) and Catalina Garc\u00eda (Monsieur Perin\u00e9).The group\u2019s members, Andrea Echeverri and H\u00e9ctor Buitrago, founded Aterciopelados in 1992 and achieved great success, both locally and internationally, thanks to a sound that was absolutely unique and innovative, free of prejudices, mixing rock with the roots of Colombian folklore and even with salsa and bossa nova.Aterciopelados have grown and evolved with each production, making history in Latin America and the rest of the world. They have released seven studio and one compilation album, selling over ten million copies of their records. Their album R\u00edo has been mentioned by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 10 best Latin rock albums of all times.They have earned two Latin Grammy awards and been nominated on multiple occasions for the Grammy.

It includes songs that made the \u201c50 most viral songs of Colombia.\u201dThis is an album filled with environmental-friendly elements, and all related videos of the group are already available on the Vevo channel on Youtube and available on all streaming and online purchasing websites.

Though fans have clamored for each \u201cReal TAUK\u201d release (now up to Volume 3) they\u2019ve also reveled in the deep sonic explorations from the band\u2019s studio forays.Their most recent studio album Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, offered an unsettling but ultimately exhilarating look at artificial intelligence and its potential to upend our world. With its dynamic sense of tension and cinematic mastery of mood, it proved to be an album that\u2019s bothpowerfully hypnotic and intensely thought-provoking.\u201cWe\u2019re all very much interested in A.I., and this idea of machines getting out of the hands of the people trying to control them,\u201d notes TAUK guitarist Matt Jalbert, whose bandmates include bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel. \u201cThis album felt like a good setting to tell that kind of story, but in a way where we could have fun with it and let the listener escape into a whole other world.\u201dEqually inspired by classic sci-fi like Blade Runner and more recent films like Ex Machina, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak embeds that narrative into TAUK\u2019s most sonically adventurous, emotionally expansive work to date. A continuation of their early-2018 EP Shapeshifter I: Construct, the new album picks up its predecessor\u2019s narrative thread with \u201cPrelude\u201d: a fantastically unsettling intro track whose frenetic keyboard work and chilling vocal samples set the tone for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe idea is that in the EP you\u2019re seeing the construction of this being, and in the album you\u2019re seeing it break out and become something that you can\u2019t ignore anymore,\u201d Carter explains.Free-flowing yet elaborately composed, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak came to life in collaboration with TAUK\u2019s longtime cohort Robert Carranza\u2014a Grammy Award-winning producer\/mixer\/engineer also known for his work The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Marilyn Manson, and Taj Mahal. In a departure from their previous releases (including 2016\u2019s Sir Nebula), the band shunned the typical studio environment and holed up for weeks in a long-abandoned, century-old home that Teel describes as \u201cthe Jumanji house meets Addams Family meets Amityville Horror.\u201d Located in their homeland of Long Island, the house turned out to be the ideal spot for their makeshift studio, allowing for a creativity-enhancing seclusion.Inspired by their work on Shapeshifter II: Outbreak TAUK has taken to broadening their live sonic palette to include a vast spectrum of synth sounds and programmed effects (such as those exquisitely eerie vocal samples heard in \u201cPrelude\u201d)Esteemed musicians who contributed to the album such as The Naughty Horns and Ghost-Note\u2019s Nate Werth (a percussionist who\u2019s also played with David Crosby, Q-Tip, and Snarky Puppy) have also joined the band onstage.Each Real TAUK release showcases the potent chemistry they discovered in childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. After playing together in various projects, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. Since then, TAUK have shared stages with acts like Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Widespread Panic, and Lettuce, appeared at festivals like Electric Forest and Bonnaroo, and earned acclaim from major outlets like the Washington Post (who praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d). As Teel points out, the band\u2019s incessant touring over the years has significantly strengthened their musical connection. \u201cThe four of us as individuals are all very animated souls in our own right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe each have our ideas and our perspectives, and when it all comes together, it creates this collective statement that takes on a life of its own.\u201d","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"18.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/tauk-with-kalu-and-the-electric-joint-mohawk-tickets-83366317901","validFrom":"2019-12-06T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Dan Rodriguez @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F90410375%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200131-231547?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=605a79db71a76a0e1be9cca8501eae4a","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/dan-rodriguez-mohawk-indoor--92409131199\/","startDate":"2020-04-05T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-05T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-06T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Hi, I\u2019m Dan.

When I\u2019m not in my studio writing songs and cutting records, or on the road playing shows, I\u2019m usually tending to our backyard chickens, eating fresh veggies from my wife\u2019s huge garden, making syrup from our city maples, or doing one of my many outdoor hobbies.Now here are a few things about my music career that I should probably share in a music bio:\u2022 In September 2014 Budweiser released their &quot;Friends Are Waiting&quot; commercial campaign featuring me singing my song When You Come Home and it premiered during the Super Bowl.\u2022 In February, 2018, I released my newest album 25 Years and is the most prolific and widely distributed album to date, featuring songs that have been placed in major ads as well as widely played Spotify playlists.\u2022 In October, 2018, Miller Lite featured my newest single \u201cSo Good\u201d in one of their commercials that played for months during NFL games on ESPN &amp; more.\u2022 In March, 2019, my song \u201cYou Feel Like Home\u201d was featured in Explore Minnesota Tourism\u2019s newest ad campaign.\u2022 Over the years I\u2019ve had the honor of sharing the stage with some really cool artists &amp; bands including The Civil Wars, Andy Grammer, Eric Hutchinson, Matt Nathanson, NeedtoBreathe, Augustana, Tyrone Wells, Haley Reinhart, John McLaughlin, Will Hoge, Drew Holcomb, Sister Hazel, and more.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"12.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/dan-rodriguez-mohawk-indoor-tickets-92409131199","validFrom":"2020-02-07T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Code Orange @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F88462341%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200120-172922?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=2a16189cfa1a7df64ba4613eee2ff0fa","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/code-orange-mohawk-86742584405\/","startDate":"2020-04-07T18:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-07T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-08T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Nothing lasts forever. All things decay, all things change. The mightiest empires crumble to dust as their kings bleed. Forever, it would seem, is unobtainable.Code Orange, with their new studio album, seek to obtain the unobtainable; pushing against every boundary, shedding every label. The band has grown immensely, and yet still retains the distinct edge and harshness that has become their caustic calling card. Ever defiant, Code Orange breaks any mold and refuses to be easily defined.Recorded with producers Will Yip at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, PA and Kurt Ballou at GodCity Studios in Salem, MA, FOREVER is an album without limits. Jami Morgan (Drums \/ Vocals), Eric Balderose (Guitar \/ Vocals), Reba Meyers (Guitar \/ Vocals) and Joe Goldman (Bass) pushed themselves to create something wholly unique and startling. \u201cWe don\u2019t just jam out and make an album. It\u2019s meticulous. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a lot of hours. It\u2019s a lot of frustration,\u201d Morgan remarked of the experience. \u201cIt took a lot of effort, but we wanted to create something that, when I put it on my headphones, I just knew. There was no doubt that this was it. If there was doubt, we\u2019d scrap it and we\u2019d do it again. It was tough getting it all to fit together, but when it did it was beautiful.\u201dThe easy route would have been for Code Orange to simply make another record like their 2014 breakthrough, I AM KING. It would have been easy to just enter the studio and churn out the same old thing, but for Code Orange, easy is never an option. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just making records to make records. When you start doing that, you\u2019re everyone else,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re built on not doing the same old shit. When you put on a Code Orange record, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna get. You know it\u2019s gonna be painful, that\u2019s it.\u201dThe contrast between beauty and pain is prevalent throughout FOREVER. The album\u2019s title track is a sludge-fueled nightmare that pummels the listener; it\u2019s Code Orange at their heaviest. Moments later, melody and hints of gracefulness enter with Meyers\u2019 striking vocals on the song \u201cBleeding in the Blur,\u201d only to be ripped away a track later during the electronic hellscape of \u201cThe Mud.\u201d FOREVER is consistent only in its willingness to change and shift.\u201cWe just take it further, but keep it brief,\u201d Morgan stated of the record\u2019s more transcendent moments. Beauty and grace leak through, but are crushed under the weight of the band\u2019s sonic assault.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to keep it painful, because we\u2019re not post. We\u2019re not post anything. We\u2019re current. We\u2019re now.\u201dOf the new album, Rolling Stone said, \u201cFOREVER captures some of the most punishing noise the band has recorded to date, featuring songs rife with sudden transitions to still-harsher textures.\u201d\u00a0 The Nerdist added, \u201cThere\u2019s growth here, for sure, but that unmistakable Code Orange sound is still present and pounding you into submission.\u201dNothing lasts forever, so Code Orange is content to live in the moment. All they want is to challenge themselves and those around them. To push every button they can. To cause some mayhem and see some blood.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s about reinforcing that we are the four. We\u2019re Code Orange,\u201d Morgan declared. \u201cWe\u2019ve been Code Orange since we were fourteen years old.\u201d","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"19.00","highPrice":"21.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/code-orange-mohawk-tickets-86742584405","validFrom":"2020-01-24T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Code Orange"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Show Me the Body"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Jesus Piece"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Year of the Knife"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Machine Girl"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"TOPS @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F91292615%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200206-203827?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=59f756ca614b8a2f7e77d75f3e689812","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/tops-mohawk-74517440671\/","startDate":"2020-04-09T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-09T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-10T06:00:00-05:00","description":"TOPS were formed in Montreal in 2011 when song-writing duo David Carriere and Jane Penny decided to join forces with drummer Riley Fleck. Since then they have become one of the most influential underground bands of the past decade, creating a space for sophisticated pop music in the indie world.Within the vibrant community surrounding Arbutus Records at the time of their formation, TOPS forged a unique sound. The only traditional \u2018band\u2019 on the label\u2019s roster, they\u2019ve built a significant following of fans, a dedicated audience at their live shows and a musical connection that continues to deepen as the years go by. With their newly minted label - Musique TOPS -\u00a0the band is poised to release their best work to date.Their tendency to opt towards making straight-forward, stripped down and honest recordings lets their pop songwriting shine out in the open. With a heart firmly attached to their sleeves, their songcraft delves into the emotional intricacy of personal relationships, asking questions about power and desire. Riley Fleck\u2019s measured drumming and David Carriere\u2019s trademark guitar licks mesh with Marta Cikojevic\u2019s lush keyboards. All these elements work in tandem and in service of Jane Penny\u2019s unmistakable, wistful voice.The result of this mixture is a collection of three self-produced records and a handful of singles that cover a range of moods and a complex emotional realm while maintaining a groove and musicality. Soft rock infused pop hits flow easily, surrounded by their signature moody ballads.TOPS are celebrating the launch of their own record label, Musique TOPS, by sharing two unreleased songs, taken from the recording sessions of the band\u2019s most recent LP, Sugar at the Gate. The haunted 70\u2019s folk elegance of \u201cEcho of Dawn\u201d is paired with the energetic \u201cVII Minutes\u201d, a classic example of the band\u2019s uptempo, breezy sound.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"16.00","highPrice":"18.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/tops-mohawk-tickets-74517440671","validFrom":"2019-10-25T10:00:00-05:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"TOPS"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Honey Harper"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Zettajoule"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Kevin Morby -

As Warp\u2019s longest serving active artist, he has broadened the sound of the label and paved the way for artists such as Flying Lotus, Hudson Mohawke and Mount Kimbie.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"22.00","highPrice":"22.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/nightmares-on-wax-dj-set-mohawk-tickets-79797906687","validFrom":"2019-12-06T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Nightmares On Wax"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Why Bonnie @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F92858903%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200217-182154?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=66fb490358fcab6757958fa283821a22","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/why-bonnie-mohawk-indoor--93156530691\/","startDate":"2020-04-17T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-17T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-18T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"12.00","highPrice":"12.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/why-bonnie-mohawk-indoor-tickets-93156530691","validFrom":"2020-02-28T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Why Bonnie"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Pelvis Wrestley"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Nevil"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Turkuaz @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F88850593%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200122-172151?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=e253179d4cca6f51619f5c100c303251","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/turkuaz-mohawk-80800998963\/","startDate":"2020-04-18T20:30:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-18T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-19T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Balancing male-female harmonies, strutting guitars, wild horn arrangements, and interminable grooves, a spirit takes shape on stage nightly for Turkuaz via larger-than-life performances.

A lush and dazzling head-trip,\u00a0Pang\u00a0has captured the hearts of a fast-growing audience of romantic pop devotees since it\u2019s October 2019 release. Known equally for her exhilarating live vocal performances, Caroline is bringing\u00a0Pang\u00a0in it\u2019s full surrealist-goth theatricality to select cities and festivals throughout 2020.Polachek has already lived an extraordinary life in music. Her previous band, Chairlift, formed in 2006 while Caroline was in art school in New York City, and her idiosyncratic vocal style and synth textures quickly became their sonic trademark, which continued to evolve through their three critically acclaimed albums.Caroline expanded into production in 2013, landing her first credit writing and producing on Beyonce&#039;s Grammy-nominated self-titled album. Restless while making Chairlift&#039;s third (and final) record\u00a0Moth, Caroline quietly fostered two side projects: baroque girl-group Ramona Lisa, and minimal synth project CEP. Moving fluidly through radically different genres, Caroline collaborated with dozens of artists (Blood Orange, SBTRKT, Charli XCX); sometimes writing, sometimes singing, sometimes directing videos, and sometimes all three.Chairlift disbanded in 2017 and Caroline feverishly began writing for her first solo project under her own name. For the first time, the DNA of these previous projects fused; the playfulness of Chairlift, the psych-classicism of Ramona Lisa, the futuristic glimmerings of CEP, plus a newfound mastery of her voice.Fast forward two years spent manically between the studio and navigating a series of intense personal crossroads, and\u00a0Pang\u00a0is decidedly the most ambitious, hardcore and beautiful record of her career to date. With her signature &#039;organic autotune&#039; and liquid lyricism center stage,\u00a0Pang\u00a0positions her firmly as one of the most singular and captivating singer-songwriters of a generation.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"17.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/caroline-polachek-mohawk-tickets-83067219289","validFrom":"2019-12-11T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Caroline Polachek"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Christelle Bofale"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Surf Curse @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F84724195%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191216-183104?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=74a25c824adb892f7c9d27a0c724b95f","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/surf-curse-mohawk-86249682121\/","startDate":"2020-04-24T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-24T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-25T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Surf Curse is the indie rock recording project of Los Angeles based songwriters Nick Rattigan and Jacob Rubeck.

Growing up on the \u2018Rez\u2019, close to a predominantly white town, the two faced similar challenges, but ultimately found refuge in Hip-hop and inspiration in each other\u2019s talents. Snotty Nose Rez Kids (SNRK) was born in 2016, forged from a life-long friendship between two emcees that used music to create, connect with their culture and language, and as an outlet to express themselves.SNRK released two albums in 2017, the first a self-titled project, and the second, The Average Savage, just nine months later. Both solid projects by a new group, The Average Savage gained unlikely notoriety for a small release. The Average Savage resulted in SNRK winning Best Hip Hop Act at the Western Canadian Music Awards (WCMA), landed them on the coveted Polaris Prize Top-ten Shortlist, and received a nomination for Best Indigenous Music Album from theJuno\u2019s. Rising popularity prepared them for their strongest release in 2019, TRAPLINE, which centred their nation, The Haisla Nation, Haisla teachings, the matriarchs in their lives, and created a bridge to other marginalized experiences, tapping The Sorority, Cartel Madras, Brevner, Boslen, and Kimmortal all for features. TRAPLINE has been streamed over 3million times, it\u2019s music videos, viewed over 800,000 times, and it\u2019s constant radio play kept it on the EarshotTop 10 Hip-Hop charts for over 20 weeks. The album was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize, making SNRK one of only 3 artists to ever be shortlisted in back-to- back years. Amidst it\u2019s success, the duo was recognized as Breakout Artist of 2019 at the WCMA\u2019s.Having spent over two years perfecting their live show, SNRK embarked on an ambitions tour in 2019 with over 80 dates across Canada, Australia, Mexico, US, UK and Netherlands. Their Canadian headline tour was a success selling out across the country, and they were headliner or surprise hit of multiple festivals, sharing stages with Method Man &amp; Red Man, Ice Cube, and Cypress Hill. Best described as thought-provoking club bangers, SNRK\u2019s live performance has unparalleled energy and audiences will dance and sweat, but they\u2019ll leave with new knowledge.Preparing for 2020, SNRK are back in the studio writing new music, working on new collaborations with artists in multiple genres, and further developing their craft. They are looking forward to taking their artistry to new heights and into new parts of the world this year.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"10.00","highPrice":"13.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/snotty-nose-rez-kids-mohawk-indoor-tickets-92286035015","validFrom":"2020-02-07T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Snotty Nose Rez Kids"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Lilly Hiatt @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F86967865%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200109-170903?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=4ac9448b320cccbfeea842ba33c2009b","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/lilly-hiatt-mohawk-indoor--73296556975\/","startDate":"2020-04-25T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-26T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Written during a winter of deep stillness and self-reflection, Lilly Hiatt\u2019s striking new album,\u2018Walking Proof,\u2019 artfully balances the songwriter\u2019s rough, rock and roll exterior with her tender,country roots, exuding a bold vulnerability as she takes a long, hard look in the mirror and deconstructs her relationship with herself and the world around her. Produced by former Cagethe Elephant guitarist Lincoln Parish and featuring guest appearances from Amanda Shires,Aaron Lee Tasjan, and legendary songwriter John Hiatt (who appears on record with his    daughter here for the very first time), the collection is fueled by longing and gratitude in equal measure, effortlessly shifting from gentle intimacy to brawny grit and back over the course of its eleven insightful tracks. Despite all the weighty themes, \u2018Walking Proof\u2019 still manages to emerge as a work of hope and optimism, offering both a newfound maturity and an abiding sense of calm in the face of chaos as Hiatt learns to make peace with just how much of life lies beyond her control.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to live and let live, to be able to accept things for what they are,\u201d says Hiatt.\u201cComing to terms with those sorts of boundaries has inspired a lot of growth in me lately, and I\u2019ve realized that it leads to better outcomes both in relationships and in art. Things seem to bloom if you can just get out of your own way for long enough.\u201dThings have been blooming for Hiatt in a big way lately.

The band came together several years ago as a result of their shared summers working in the capitalist ruins of western Canada\u2019s forests. The seven tracks that came to form Loving\u2019s eponymous debut EP were written and recorded between Victoria and Toronto in the winter of 2015. The humbly-rendered collection of lo-fi psychedelic folk songs found success online and the band amassed an organic fanbase. Thus inspired to continue the project, Jesse and David decamped to Gabriola Island in the spring of 2017 to begin work on new material. There, they set up a recording studio in Jesse and Lucas\u2019 late grandmother\u2019s seaside home and demoed the songs that would form the backbone of If I Am Only My Thoughts.Released on January 31, 2020 on Last Gang Records, If I Am Only My Thoughts is Loving\u2019s first full-length album. With lyrics written by both Jesse and Lucas, the lush, homespun collection of songs was recorded, mixed, and mastered by David in his basement studio in Victoria. To contrast, these songs are balmy and inviting, a series of open-ended questions that circle the many uncertainties of existence. While the production on If I Am Only My Thoughts inspires a sense of ease, it is deceptively intricate. The underlying tape hiss and handcrafted aesthetic heard on Loving is still present, and that lends the album intimacy. Take the instrumental track \u201cJanuary,\u201d which sounds like a harsh winter\u2019s day spent in front of a fireplace as a crystalline piano is warmed by a string arrangement written and played by collaborator Colin Nealis. If I Am Only My Thoughts offers listeners a space to ruminate on life\u2019s uncertainties and acknowledge the often strange journey of being alive. That sentiment is relayed perfectly on the title track: \u201cAdrift like light upon a riverbed, I\u2019m going somewhere I imagine\/ At least in my head, in my head, in my head.\u201dJapanese city pop, Brazilian boogie, and the songs his parents sang karaoke to, these influences help make Michael Seyer one of the most unique artists creating music in the indie-pop space today. On his new EP Nostalgia the 24 year old songwriter, born in the Philippines but raised in Gardena, a suburb of Los Angeles, set out to create songs which were both fresh and timeless.Michael Seyer developed his songwriting in the SoCal bedroom pop scene and across two self-released full-length records, 2016\u2019s Ugly Boy and 2018\u2019s Bad Bonez. Now, working with Caroline, Seyer looked to his past for inspiration. The six track EP bares the unmistakable hallmarks of classic pop from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s \u2013 the kinds of songs which strove to find a perfect balance between emotion and technique.\u00a0Standouts from the EP include the 80\u2019s pop of \u201cI Can\u2019t Dance,\u201d the saxophone filled bossa nova of \u201cHeaven Only Knows,\u201d and the smooth jazz of \u201cOh! This is Love.\u201d These are the sounds the next generation of parents will want to sing in their living rooms","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/loving-michael-seyer-mohawk-indoor-tickets-94728763281","validFrom":"2020-02-28T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"The Mountain Goats - SOLD OUT @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F82842615%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191127-165537?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=7e44427fd8f17c1359badc6e6109482c","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/the-mountain-goats-sold-out-mohawk-74213977003\/","startDate":"2020-05-01T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-05-02T06:00:00-05:00","description":"THE MOUNTAIN GOATS ARE JOHN DARNIELLE, PETER HUGHES, JON WURSTER, AND MATT DOUGLAS.

The result is a live show that is musically sophisticated but widely accessible, with a diverse and engaged fanbase that travels to out of town shows and festivals to witness the band&#039;s continually evolving sound.Yak Attack has been selling out local and regional shows and has developed a reputation as &quot;the region&#039;s go to late night act&quot; in the summer festival and afterparty circuit. They spent the early part of 2019 touring in support of live electronic heavyweights STS9 and Sunsquabi, the band has also shared the stage with emerging acts such as Fruition, Turkuaz, TAUK, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, and The Magic Beans.

When lead singer Jeb Bunting\u2019s enthralling vocals, reminiscent of Jim Morrison, combine with Alden Sayre\u2019s dynamic guitar presence, ominous synthesizer sounds, and use of low frequency oscillation the result is a dark hedonic thrill. With reverberations resembling Ghostland Observatory, Halloween Party offers a thrilling distinction.The unmistakable chemistry between Jeb and Alden is no coincidence; the duo has been making music together since they met in high school. Over the years they have culminated their sound which has undoubtedly progressed to the inception of Halloween Party.The duo is capturing the essence of Halloween in its entirety with lyrics and tones that instantly elicit an images of old horror films. With synth layers that give off a party vibe, it creates a perfect storm that is \u201cspook pop.\u201d\u00a0Their latest singles Lullaby and Big Buried Soul exemplify the depth of Jeb and Alden\u2019s artistic prowess. Each song takes you to either side of their frightful spectrum. Big Buried Soul taps into the energetic side, a rhythmic and danceable tune that still leaves traces of obscurity. Lullaby is a more chaotic ballad which combines a similar energy but with eerie lyrics and an enthralling hook.\u00a0After hearing some unreleased tracks, and learning of upcoming performances, it\u2019s clear the pair will be making an explosive appearance in the Austin scene. Expect these spooky boys to exceed expectations and make a lasting mark with their genre defying sound.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/south-by-spook-west-mohawk-indoor-tickets-95659071859","validFrom":"2020-02-21T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Halloween Party"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Animals on TV"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Me Nd Adam"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Music of The Beatles for Kids @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F92547969%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200214-161904?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=964026ceb731bd6f881909a12c649be4","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/music-of-the-beatles-for-kids-mohawk-94223403737\/","startDate":"2020-03-08T11:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00","endDate":"2020-03-09T06:00:00-05:00","description":"The Rock and Roll Playhouse, a family concert series hosted at historic music venues across the country, allows kids to \u201cmove, play and sing while listening to works from the classic-rock canon\u201d (NY Times).

There was also Wendy Nelson (keyboards, sampling) who joined the band in the end of their career and who was a long time friend of theirs.The public was always enthusiastic to the live shows of The Skatenigs what\u2019s yet another proof for its characteristic sound mixing punk, rock, rap and metal styles with a little bit of industrial as well.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"0.00","highPrice":"0.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/skatenigs-mohawk-indoor-tickets-90725896599","validFrom":"2020-01-21T00:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Skatenigs"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Paulie Think"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Worm Suicide"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Otis the Destroyer @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F94485589%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200227-191431?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=8cca3a512a7b25aa1efa865eece0e1ea","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/otis-the-destroyer-mohawk-indoor--96205957609\/","startDate":"2020-03-08T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00","endDate":"2020-03-09T06:00:00-05:00","description":"OFFICIAL RE-LAUNCH PARTY FOR SHOWLISTAUSTIN.COM!!Welcome back Showlist Austin to the scene with a lineup of stellar music acts on the indoor Mohawk stage!featuringOtis the DestroyerThe Western CivilizationBooher---Showlist Austin is your straightforward guide to live music in Austin, Texas.

Friends and work colleagues have described them as &quot;actually pretty good&quot; and &quot;better than I expected&quot; while promising that despite the recent string of obligatory grandparent birthday celebrations, they&#039;d definitely come to the next show. The songwriting core started in the summer of 2015 as a mix of co-workers and mutual acquaintances. Blending punk, blues, and psych-rock influences, the fledgling band soon found themselves where most bands unfortunately find themselves- on Craigslist, seeking drums and bass. Netting lukewarm and confusing results on Tinder, the band found solace in the words of Nicholas Sparks, &quot;Love is like the wind, you can&#039;t see it, but you can feel it.In the winter of 2016, The Banisters felt it. They successfully filled out their rhythm section and began playing shows all around Austin. They\u2019ve since been invited to play with bands in Houston, San Antonio, San Marcos, the DFW area, and Oklahoma. Their energetic performances and irresistible rock jams have brought them to various festivals including SXSW and Deep Ellum Arts Fest. The band has been featured on KUTX&#039;s Song of the Day and was recently awarded The Deli Magazine\u2019s Austin Emerging Artist of the Month.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-banisters-4th-anniversary-show-mohawk-indoor-tickets-91641703803","validFrom":"2020-01-29T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"The Banisters"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Fertility House"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Cheap Wave"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"The Warning @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F84000785%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191209-174238?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=4531eb14cf3a9a88a5b52047e441a464","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/the-warning-mohawk-indoor--83366662933\/","startDate":"2020-03-25T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-26T06:00:00-05:00","description":"This impressive trio of sisters - Daniela (guitar and voice), Paulina (drums, piano and vocals), and Alejandra (bass, piano and vocals), have elaborate musical affinities that range from the classic rock of Queen and Pink Floyd, to sounds from more recent generations like Muse and My Chemical Romance.

I had just dropped out of college (not the first time I had dropped out of school) and was living back in my home state of California, with no fucking idea what my life was about to become. Everyday I would write a song or two about the angst, confusion, anxiety, and existential dread I felt as an early 20-something college drop out. I would sit in that little room, on a mattress on the floor, and have what felt to me like a therapy session with my guitar and a notepad. I started sending these songs to my friend Bobb Bruno, who I\u2019d known since I was 17, and he started sprinkling his parts on top of them.\u00a0I really wish I could explain Best Coast\u2019s story in a more profound way, but in all honesty, I can\u2019t\u2014because I remember so little of it. Before I knew it, we were a band with a record deal touring the world, playing on late night TV, signing peoples LP sleeves, and doing music videos with Drew Barrymore. The majority of the time that my band was taking off, I was stuck in a dark daze. My romantic relationship was a topic of conversation, my cat was asked about in interviews, my drug and alcohol abuse was on public display. Everyday was like Groundhog\u2019s Day\u2014I was repeating the same self-destructive patterns day in an day out.\u00a0We played Lollapooloza in 2011 and I literally started the set by flipping someone off in the crowd and saying, \u201cFuck you, we\u2019re Best Coast.\u201d I didn\u2019t do that because I was some badass Joan Jett rock star. I did that because I was deeply miserable and deeply insecure about what you thought of me so I wanted you to see me as someone who didn\u2019t give a fuck.\u00a0After we finished the album cycle for California Nights, something terrifying happened to me. I felt creatively paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t write music. For the first time in my entire life, I had nothing to say. There was so much bubbling inside of me, so many things happening, so much to process,\u00a0 but I couldn\u2019t get any of it out. I didn\u2019t leave my house. I drank wine alone on my couch. I watched every season of Vanderpump Rules available on Hulu. Trump had won the election. I was miserable and nothing was ever going to change. One day, I locked myself in my closet and I forced myself to write. It was the first time in years I was able to get something out. And out came \u201cEverything Has Changed.\u201d The song was like a vision of life I wished I was living. A life in which things didn\u2019t look so foggy. A life in which I didn\u2019t drink anymore. It wasn\u2019t the life I was living. Not yet. But that song was prophetic. It described the life I would soon be living.\u00a0I guess it\u2019s no secret that I was a bit of a \u201cparty girl\u201d in the early stages of Best Coast. My life went from college drop-out to Billboard-charting indie musician in a very short period of time. No one teaches you how to handle success or failure. I had zero coping skills. I turned to the only help I could think of, numbing the problems and the pain away. And it worked, until it didn\u2019t. On November 12, 2017, I decided that enough was enough and made the decision to get sober. It\u2019s been hard, it\u2019s been beautiful, it\u2019s been scary\u2014and something I\u2019m proud of. I can\u2019t tell the story of this album without mentioning my sobriety, because it\u2019s a huge part of this story.Always Tomorrow is the story of where I was and where I am now. As well as the struggles I am still learning to identify and figure out because lets face it, life is fucking hard, and like I said before, there is no guidebook.\u00a0 Some days I wake up and I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world and I forget about everything that\u2019s ever bummed me out, and other days, it all comes flooding back. This album is about leaving the darkness for the light, but still understanding that nothing is ever going to be perfect. It\u2019s an album about attempting to fix your broken patterns and learning to get out of your own way. It\u2019s about burning it all down and starting from scratch even when the idea of that is fucking terrifying. Closing one chapter and moving onto the next even when you have no idea what is on the other side. Acceptance. It\u2019s about taking a gigantic leap of faith.\u00a0I hope this record helps people. It\u2019s easier to stay comfortable in the insanity, but for me, there just came a time where I had to get off the ride. I had to look at life and ask, Why am I still doing this? I was writing the same song over and over again: I\u2019m miserable!\u00a0 But I wasn\u2019t doing much to change that. I still fail at times, but I\u2019m less afraid of failing than ever before. This record is the story of a second chance.\u00a0","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"25.00","highPrice":"25.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/best-coast-mohawk-tickets-71460836285","validFrom":"2019-11-08T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Best Coast"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Mannequin Pussy"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Austin Plaine &amp; Anthony da Costa @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F81172639%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191114-204637?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=7fc2fbec9d839a95a6facdc005ef48f5","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/austin-plaine-anthony-da-costa-mohawk-indoor--78197054495\/","startDate":"2020-03-28T21:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-28T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-29T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Like only the most insightful songwriters, Austin Plaine draws intense emotion from the subtlest moments. On his sophomore album Stratford, the Minnesota-bred, Nashville based musician shapes his lyrical storytelling with both precision and pure feeling, capturing every nuance of lost love and longing and fractured innocence. And while Stratford is steeped in a warm nostalgia, Plaine instills each song with a quiet optimism that speaks to bravely moving forward, even in troubled times.Produced by Jay Foote and mixed by Steve Vealey (M. Ward, Phoenix, Hurray for the Riff Raff) at the legendary Electric Lady Studios, Stratford arrives as the follow-up to Plaine\u2019s self-titled debut\u2014a 2015 release that earned comparisons to Bob Dylan and Conor Oberst from Baeble Music. In a departure from that more stripped-down effort, Plaine assembled a full-fledged band who recorded in an apartment in Brooklyn, infusing Stratford with a homegrown feel and loose yet kinetic energy.Taking its title from the Flatbush street where the album came to life, Stratford offers a classically arranged take on folk-rock that illuminates the intimacy of Plaine\u2019s vocal work and the graceful candor of his lyrics. From track to track, the 27-year-old singer\/guitarist reveals a refined sense of songcraft that he partly credits to moving to Nashville from his hometown of Minneapolis in early 2017. \u201cBeing part of a whole community of songwriters, you realize there\u2019s a lot of different directions you can take a song,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really opened me up as a writer, and it\u2019s also helped me to hone in on every word of every line that I write.\u201dAnthony da Costa is no stranger to the music world. At age 13 he started writing songs and playing out anywhere he could, and his career as a singer\/songwriter never really stopped. In the last decade, he\u2019s lived in New York City, Austin, TX and most recently, Nashville, TN, all of which have shaped him as a musician and led to countless opportunities and collaborations.da Costa has released many albums over the course of his career, most recently a solo LP (da Costa) and a collaboration with Adam Levy (Neighbors) in 2017, and an EP (Shadow Love) in 2019. For the last several years, he\u2019s also been consistently touring, sharing bills with bands such as Big Thief, The Milk Carton Kids, and Loretta Lynn, and sharing stages with Joy Williams (The Civil Wars), Sarah Jarosz, Molly Tuttle, and Yola, just to name a few.During his time as a sideman, da Costa\u2019s desire to write and release songs of his own remained steady. Last year he met up with long-time friend and producer Kenneth Pattengale (The Milk Carton Kids), and made what will be his next solo record, called Feet on the Dashboard, and in da Costa\u2019s words, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d A culmination of a sound developed since he was a teenager, Feet on the Dashboard is a collection of songs set to be a deliberate reintroduction to who da Costa is, and who he has always been: an earnest songwriter and an artist on his own merit.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"10.00","highPrice":"13.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/austin-plaine-anthony-da-costa-mohawk-indoor-tickets-78197054495","validFrom":"2019-11-15T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Austin Plaine"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Anthony da Costa"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Pears @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F88848831%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200122-171500?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=ee6e57ecde7d7289f2d4d353708d08eb","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/pears-mohawk-indoor--84631500095\/","startDate":"2020-03-29T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-29T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-03-30T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"13.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/pears-mohawk-indoor-tickets-84631500095","validFrom":"2020-01-24T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Pears"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Single Mothers"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Noogy"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Circle Pit @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F87471171%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200113-202541?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=1ea39545efae6bf8fa0681d51ca84b71","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/circle-pit-mohawk-indoor--86055800215\/","startDate":"2020-03-31T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-03-31T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-01T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"7.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/circle-pit-mohawk-indoor-tickets-86055800215","validFrom":"2020-01-15T11:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Circle Pit"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Zero Percent"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Hellfury"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Bondbreakr"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Josh Kelley @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F83996839%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191209-171410?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=d2f8feca7171ae534543302da8a234e1","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/josh-kelley-mohawk-indoor--83866034567\/","startDate":"2020-04-01T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-01T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-02T06:00:00-05:00","description":"\u201cIn a door frame of this lived-in home there is a pen hanging from a string, there lies the tale of a husband and a wife steady growing up their family,\u201c singer-songwriter Josh Kelley sings on \u201cBusy Making Memories,\u201d a deeply personal excerpt from his new album, I Sing. It\u2019s no secret -- and, in fact, quite apparent -- that he\u2019s a family man through and through.\u201cI wrote \u2018Busy Making Memories\u2019 on January 1, sitting in my morning coffee chair watching my kids bounce, spin and play around me, and the music just happened. It was if someone else was writing it through me,\u201d he says. \u201cI have voice notes on my phone as proof of the creative process, but still it felt like I wasn\u02bct in control. It was truly a wild experience that, to this day, I have a hard time wrapping my head around. I went to the studio and started producing, and it was an effortless process. I wish all of them could be that way.\u201dSince the release of his last album of original material, 2016\u2019s New Lane Road, Josh and his wife welcomed their third child; within the 10 songs on I Sing, Kelley paints a picture of a man who has found his place in life nestled deep into the small mountain town they call home.\u201cMy family brings me so much joy,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the most part, family is what connects every song on this album -\u2013 my every day with my wife. Watching my kids grow up is just amazing and inspiring.\u201d Josh creates most of his music in a barn on his property that he\u2019s converted into a studio. He produced and engineered the entirety of his new project himself; he\u2019s been self-producing music since he was 15-years-old, and really dug into engineering and mixing when he moved to Los Angeles in 2002. He also plays 15 different instruments.\u201cMy recording process has changed over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to start a song and then begin the production process before the song was even finished. Now that I\u2019m older I\u2019ve changed my ways, and I make sure all of the structure, tempo, and lyrics are perfect. Then I drive over to my studio and try to wrap my head around how the song should live in people\u2019s ears. It\u2019s better for me to finish the song musically and lyrically before ever turning anything else on.\u201dOn I Sing, Kelley solidifies himself as a talented vocalist and lyricist while tapping into the details of an everyday family. He\u2019s watching his kids develop their own personalities and continuing to find new reasons to love his wife after close to 15 years together. He\u2019s missing it all when he\u2019s away from them. He says, outside of his family, the one other constant in his daily life is singing.Writing I Sing began with \u201cLove Her Boy,\u201d a smooth and soulful number that finds Josh delving into different uses for the phrase. He started experimenting with wordplay, which carries throughout the album.\u201cI was trying to write a totally different song on a plane back home from a Colorado festival,\u201d he says, explaining that he wrote the title down and filed it away for a writing session he had the next day. \u201cI brought the idea of \u2018love her boy\u2019 to the session. The different uses within the song create an oronym, two phrases that sound the same but mean different things. I think it\u2019s a clever angle, and we had so much fun bringing it to life.\u201d\u201cWe Don\u2019t Need The Money\u201d finds Josh and co-writer Eric Kertes reversing their usual roles to create a funky groove; \u201cBack To You\u201d begs for a sing-along; \u201cIf That\u2019s Alright\u201d continues the theme. \u201cYou Can Count On Me,\u201d with a cameo on background vocals from his daughters, takes its sonic inspiration from Bill Withers and Shuggie Otis. It was written with Alen Chang. \u201cI was only a melody man and co-lyricist -- we talked about people in our lives that needed our support and what we would say to them if we were brave enough to say it,\u201d Josh says. \u201cI showed up to Alen\u2019s house, and after describing the concept, he had the idea in his head within minutes. On this rare occasion, I was only a melody man and co-lyricist. The song was done by dinner time.\u201d\u201cYou And I,\u201d written with Nashville songwriter Dustin Christensen, slows things down with an ode to an all-consuming kind of love. \u201cI can\u02bct imagine my life without my person because we have created this safe place that is sometimes almost unbearable to leave,\u201d Josh says. \u201cI Want You Tonight,\u201d \u201cBecause I Love You\u201d and \u201cLoves You Like Me\u201d are straight-up love songs. \u201cI\u02bcm a sucker for these and I\u02bcll keep writing them till the day I float away,\u201d Josh says.Growing up in Augusta, Georgia, Josh absorbed R&amp;B, soul, and vintage country, while also developing an affinity for classic rock. His musical family would often sit around their piano creating songs. When he was 12, his older brother accidentally left his guitar at home when he headed back to college -- a month later, he was covering Led Zeppelin songs. The rest is history.\u201cMy sister\u2019s husband, Kris, taught me different scales on the guitar and introduced me to Stevie Ray Vaughan,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mind on playing the blues for many years because of him. I learned from many of these songs that simple musical progressions lent room for more complicated and beautiful melodies.\u201dDuring their early teens, Josh and his younger brother Charles (now one-third of Lady Antebellum) formed a band, Inside Blue, whose self-released album gained local radio airplay and caught the attention of soul legend James Brown. Josh released his solo debut, Changing Faces, while attending the University of Mississippi. He then signed a record deal with Hollywood Records, which released his 2003 mainstream debut For the Ride Home. He found a Top Five single with \u201cAmazing,\u201d and his second album Almost Honest, included the Top Ten single \u201cOnly You.\u201dJosh later released four independent albums \u2014 Just Say the Word, Special Company, Backwoods and To Remember \u2014 between 2006 and 2008. He released Georgia Clay in 2011 with MCA Nashville, and 2015\u2019s New Lane Road with Sugar Hill Records. In 2017 he independently released an album of covers, titledUnder the Covers, Vol. 1, and a holiday album, Christmas Traditions. He has appeared on \u201cThe Ellen Degeneres Show,\u201d \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\u201d \u201cLive with Regis &amp; Kelly\u201d and \u201cLast Call with Carson Daly,\u201d and his songs have been featured on such shows as \u201cSmallville,\u201d \u201cScrubs,\u201d \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d and MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Hills.\u201d Josh also wrote and performed the theme song for the TV sitcom \u201cMike and Molly,\u201d scored the feature film Home Sweet Hell, and created the theme song for TV\u2019s Golf Channel.\u201cI will never stop creating music \u2013 it is in my blood and it is what I was put on this earth to do,\u201d he says. Josh Kelley launched his artist career in 2001 out of his college dorm room that propelled him into the industry with his hit song \u201cAmazing\u201d. It was the most played song of the year on pop radio and topped the charts at number 5. Since then Josh has toured with some of music\u2019s biggest names including Taylor Swift, Dave Matthews Band, and Lady Antebellum.

Little by little, the band consolidated its local fame by staying on tour until 1996.It is in this year that David Byrne, while shopping at a record store in New York, accidentally finds one of the copies left by Los Amigos on consignment and immediately begins the process of conversations that led to signing them for his record label \u201cLuaka Bop\u201d. After months of conversations, pre-production and production, in 1998 they released their first album for the label of the former Talking Heads, \u201cThe New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera\u201d, produced by Andr\u00e9s Lev\u00edn, which had hits like \u201cPonerte en Cuatro\u201d, \u201cSexy\u201d and \u201cDisco Anal\u201d.Two years later the band moves to the city of San Francisco for 2 months to record their next album and it is at this time that the band is considering the possibility of moving permanently to the United States to continue their career.At the end of 2000 they put on sale their third album \u201cArepa 3000: A Venezuelan Journey Into Space\u201d produced by Phillip Steir which is nominated for a Grammy Award and a Latin Grammy. Of this disc they leave subjects like \u201cCuchi Cuchi\u201d and \u201cThe Neighbor\u201d.After almost a year of planning, the band decided to move to New York City on January 23, 2001. During their first year in the city, Los Amigos began a friendly and working relationship with the legends of the dance world \u201cMasters At Work\u201d which leads them to enter the studio in early 2002 to record what would be their fourth album.\u201cThe Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1\u201d produced by Masters At Work, is published in Venezuela in 2003 and in the United States in 2004 and that same year they are nominated for a Latin Grammy in the category of Best Alternative Latin Album. Being their most mature album according to the criterion of many fans, Los Amigos achieve an impeccable and unique sound and include songs of more than 8 minutes with long instrumental sections, remembering the great recordings that were made in the 70s and 80s.In 2006, Los Amigos Invisibles ended their contract with the Luaka Bop label and independently edited their album \u201cSuperpop Venezuela\u201d. This album is a collection of Venezuelan songs from the 60s, 70s and 80s. This album is nominated for a Grammy in the category \u201cBest Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album\u201d. This would be their 2nd nomination to the American Grammys.In 2008 they released their first album and live DVD called \u201cEn una noche tan linda como esta\u201d and began the process of recording their 6th studio album.\u201cComercial\u201d (Eng: \u201cCommercial\u201d) goes on sale in 2009 and Los Amigos Invisibles is nominated for its 3rd Latin Grammy. On Thursday, November 5, at a ceremony held in the city of Las Vegas, Los Amigos Invisibles win their first Latin Grammy.\u201cRepeat After Me\u201d, their 7th studio album, released in 2013. It earned the band the Latin Grammy nominations for Best Latin \/ Alternative Rock Album and for Best Packaging Design.In 2015 fans of Los Amigos Invisibles enjoyed a CD\/DVD recorded in Mexico City that included versions of their greatest hits in bolero, reggae, bossa nova, cha cha ch\u00e1 and other rhythms. To achieve this concept, the Venezuelan band used new instruments and invited important musicians from the Latin American music scene to participate. Natalia Lafourcade, Alex Syntek, Jay de la Cueva (Moderatto), Venezuelan Mariana Vega, Gil Cerezo (Kinky), a Brazilian percussion group and a string quartet. Los Amigos Invisibles closed 2015 with more than 50 concerts in 10 different countries.In 2016, accompanied by artists of the likes of Carlos Vives, Santiago Cruz, Franco de Vita, Kany Garcia and Ricardo Montaner, Los Amigos Invisibles lead a record production directed by Sony US\/Latin to honor one of the greats of music: Yordano Los Amigos Invisibles lead this record material entitled \u201cEl Tren de los Regresos\u201d.On October 14, 2016 Los Amigos Invisibles published on all the platforms \u201cDame El Mambo\u201d, the first single from their most recent album \u201cEl Paradise\u201d, which came to light at the beginning of 2017.

Earlier in 2018 \u201cEl Paradise\u201d was nominated for the Best Latin Rock, Urbano r Alternative Album Grammy.Aterciopelados, the pioneer Latin-American folk-rock group, returns after 8 years with their first long and live project entitled \u201cReluciente, Rechinante y Aterciopelado.\u201d This CD+DVD is a compilation of the most representative songs of their repertoire that celebrates over two decades of their existence as a band. It features the participation of big names, such as Macaco, Le\u00f3n Larregui (vocals for the Mexican group Zo\u00e9), Goyo (Chocquibtown) and Catalina Garc\u00eda (Monsieur Perin\u00e9).The group\u2019s members, Andrea Echeverri and H\u00e9ctor Buitrago, founded Aterciopelados in 1992 and achieved great success, both locally and internationally, thanks to a sound that was absolutely unique and innovative, free of prejudices, mixing rock with the roots of Colombian folklore and even with salsa and bossa nova.Aterciopelados have grown and evolved with each production, making history in Latin America and the rest of the world. They have released seven studio and one compilation album, selling over ten million copies of their records. Their album R\u00edo has been mentioned by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 10 best Latin rock albums of all times.They have earned two Latin Grammy awards and been nominated on multiple occasions for the Grammy. Aterciopelados are also Amnesty International ambassadors focusing on the fight against abuse of women and have been strong activists since the beginning of their journey as a group, as well as individually, with Andrea releasing three studio recordings (\u201cAndrea Echeverri\u201d, \u201cDos\u201d &amp; \u201cRuise\u00f1ora\u201d) that reveal a very clear position regarding gender issues and the rights of women. The first one of said albums carries her name.Furthermore, Hector, who is composer and producer for many up and coming artists, has always been interested in the environment and the legacy from ancestral indigenous people, and has actively participated in organizing \u201cCanto al Agua,\u201d an intercultural network focusing on healing and caring for the water. His soloist discography consists of his albums \u201cConector\u201d, \u201cConector II\u201d and \u201cNi\u00f1os Cristal\u201d.Hector and Andrea are currently presenting \u201cReluciente, Rechinante y Aterciopelado\u201d, homage to all the songs that turned them into one of the greatest and most renowned rock bands in Colombia and worldwide. As a result of their getting together after a three-year recess and with the objective of presenting their greatest hits at the 20 years of Rock al Parque, they have created this CD+DVD. It includes songs that made the \u201c50 most viral songs of Colombia.\u201dThis is an album filled with environmental-friendly elements, and all related videos of the group are already available on the Vevo channel on Youtube and available on all streaming and online purchasing websites. It is a summary of the greatest hits of a legendary band that has left its imprint on more than one generation for over two decades.In the middle of their world tour \u201cReluciente, Rechinante 2017\u201d, in which they support the release of the live album that bears this name in different countries in Europe, Aterciopelados\u2019 pays tribute to Juan Gabriel, with its version of \u201cHe venido a pedirte Perd\u00f3n\u201d.According to Andrea and H\u00e9ctor, this song is \u201cSound nu disco and plancha futurista\u201d, referring to the term \u2018iron music\u2019 that in Colombia encompasses the great songwriters of Latin music of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"","highPrice":"","priceCurrency":"","availability":"InStock","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/35gVJ19"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Leftover Crack + The Casualties @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F90929631%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200204-221010?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=8a0ad93ab7646639656e160ef3e1d6f0","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/leftover-crack-the-casualties-mohawk-90387891617\/","startDate":"2020-04-03T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-03T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-04T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"20.00","highPrice":"25.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/leftover-crack-the-casualties-mohawk-tickets-90387891617","validFrom":"2020-02-07T13:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Leftover Crack"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"The Casualties"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Grade 2"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"The Last Gang"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Black Pool x Cody Lovaas @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F93588069%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200221-173232?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=b0350831b703675259f01311a410899a","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/black-pool-x-cody-lovaas-mohawk-indoor--88917708259\/","startDate":"2020-04-03T21:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-03T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-04T06:00:00-05:00","description":"","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/black-pool-x-cody-lovaas-mohawk-indoor-tickets-88917708259","validFrom":"2020-02-21T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"TAUK with Kalu and The Electric Joint @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F82865899%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191127-193806?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=1e9cba021ab52319271d19d0ecffaae8","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/tauk-with-kalu-and-the-electric-joint-mohawk-83366317901\/","startDate":"2020-04-04T19:30:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-04T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-05T06:00:00-05:00","description":"New York-bred TAUK has been laying down an all-instrumental blend of progressive rock, hip- hop and jazz on stages across the U.S. for the last several years, and recently released several iterations of \u201cReal TAUK\u201d, to document some of the great moments from each tour. Though fans have clamored for each \u201cReal TAUK\u201d release (now up to Volume 3) they\u2019ve also reveled in the deep sonic explorations from the band\u2019s studio forays.Their most recent studio album Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, offered an unsettling but ultimately exhilarating look at artificial intelligence and its potential to upend our world. With its dynamic sense of tension and cinematic mastery of mood, it proved to be an album that\u2019s bothpowerfully hypnotic and intensely thought-provoking.\u201cWe\u2019re all very much interested in A.I., and this idea of machines getting out of the hands of the people trying to control them,\u201d notes TAUK guitarist Matt Jalbert, whose bandmates include bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel. \u201cThis album felt like a good setting to tell that kind of story, but in a way where we could have fun with it and let the listener escape into a whole other world.\u201dEqually inspired by classic sci-fi like Blade Runner and more recent films like Ex Machina, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak embeds that narrative into TAUK\u2019s most sonically adventurous, emotionally expansive work to date. A continuation of their early-2018 EP Shapeshifter I: Construct, the new album picks up its predecessor\u2019s narrative thread with \u201cPrelude\u201d: a fantastically unsettling intro track whose frenetic keyboard work and chilling vocal samples set the tone for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe idea is that in the EP you\u2019re seeing the construction of this being, and in the album you\u2019re seeing it break out and become something that you can\u2019t ignore anymore,\u201d Carter explains.Free-flowing yet elaborately composed, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak came to life in collaboration with TAUK\u2019s longtime cohort Robert Carranza\u2014a Grammy Award-winning producer\/mixer\/engineer also known for his work The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Marilyn Manson, and Taj Mahal. In a departure from their previous releases (including 2016\u2019s Sir Nebula), the band shunned the typical studio environment and holed up for weeks in a long-abandoned, century-old home that Teel describes as \u201cthe Jumanji house meets Addams Family meets Amityville Horror.\u201d Located in their homeland of Long Island, the house turned out to be the ideal spot for their makeshift studio, allowing for a creativity-enhancing seclusion.Inspired by their work on Shapeshifter II: Outbreak TAUK has taken to broadening their live sonic palette to include a vast spectrum of synth sounds and programmed effects (such as those exquisitely eerie vocal samples heard in \u201cPrelude\u201d)Esteemed musicians who contributed to the album such as The Naughty Horns and Ghost-Note\u2019s Nate Werth (a percussionist who\u2019s also played with David Crosby, Q-Tip, and Snarky Puppy) have also joined the band onstage.Each Real TAUK release showcases the potent chemistry they discovered in childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. After playing together in various projects, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. Since then, TAUK have shared stages with acts like Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Widespread Panic, and Lettuce, appeared at festivals like Electric Forest and Bonnaroo, and earned acclaim from major outlets like the Washington Post (who praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d). As Teel points out, the band\u2019s incessant touring over the years has significantly strengthened their musical connection. \u201cThe four of us as individuals are all very animated souls in our own right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe each have our ideas and our perspectives, and when it all comes together, it creates this collective statement that takes on a life of its own.\u201d","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"18.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/tauk-with-kalu-and-the-electric-joint-mohawk-tickets-83366317901","validFrom":"2019-12-06T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Dan Rodriguez @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F90410375%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200131-231547?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=605a79db71a76a0e1be9cca8501eae4a","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/dan-rodriguez-mohawk-indoor--92409131199\/","startDate":"2020-04-05T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-05T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-06T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Hi, I\u2019m Dan. I\u2019m a whiskey &amp; beer drinking, fishing &amp; hunting loving, motorcycle riding, quality food eating, hippie sympathizing, people loving, husband &amp; father who lives in Minneapolis and shares a life with my amazing wife Megan and two adorable sons named Oak and Alder. I grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, MI, and moved to Minneapolis when I was 18 to study music. I ended up staying because I\u2019m one of those crazy people that enjoys the snow and cold weather.Music is my trade &amp; performing it for people is my passion. When I\u2019m not in my studio writing songs and cutting records, or on the road playing shows, I\u2019m usually tending to our backyard chickens, eating fresh veggies from my wife\u2019s huge garden, making syrup from our city maples, or doing one of my many outdoor hobbies.Now here are a few things about my music career that I should probably share in a music bio:\u2022 In September 2014 Budweiser released their &quot;Friends Are Waiting&quot; commercial campaign featuring me singing my song When You Come Home and it premiered during the Super Bowl.\u2022 In February, 2018, I released my newest album 25 Years and is the most prolific and widely distributed album to date, featuring songs that have been placed in major ads as well as widely played Spotify playlists.\u2022 In October, 2018, Miller Lite featured my newest single \u201cSo Good\u201d in one of their commercials that played for months during NFL games on ESPN &amp; more.\u2022 In March, 2019, my song \u201cYou Feel Like Home\u201d was featured in Explore Minnesota Tourism\u2019s newest ad campaign.\u2022 Over the years I\u2019ve had the honor of sharing the stage with some really cool artists &amp; bands including The Civil Wars, Andy Grammer, Eric Hutchinson, Matt Nathanson, NeedtoBreathe, Augustana, Tyrone Wells, Haley Reinhart, John McLaughlin, Will Hoge, Drew Holcomb, Sister Hazel, and more.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"12.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/dan-rodriguez-mohawk-indoor-tickets-92409131199","validFrom":"2020-02-07T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Code Orange @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F88462341%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200120-172922?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=2a16189cfa1a7df64ba4613eee2ff0fa","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/code-orange-mohawk-86742584405\/","startDate":"2020-04-07T18:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-07T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-08T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Nothing lasts forever. All things decay, all things change. The mightiest empires crumble to dust as their kings bleed. Forever, it would seem, is unobtainable.Code Orange, with their new studio album, seek to obtain the unobtainable; pushing against every boundary, shedding every label. The band has grown immensely, and yet still retains the distinct edge and harshness that has become their caustic calling card. Ever defiant, Code Orange breaks any mold and refuses to be easily defined.Recorded with producers Will Yip at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, PA and Kurt Ballou at GodCity Studios in Salem, MA, FOREVER is an album without limits. Jami Morgan (Drums \/ Vocals), Eric Balderose (Guitar \/ Vocals), Reba Meyers (Guitar \/ Vocals) and Joe Goldman (Bass) pushed themselves to create something wholly unique and startling. \u201cWe don\u2019t just jam out and make an album. It\u2019s meticulous. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a lot of hours. It\u2019s a lot of frustration,\u201d Morgan remarked of the experience. \u201cIt took a lot of effort, but we wanted to create something that, when I put it on my headphones, I just knew. There was no doubt that this was it. If there was doubt, we\u2019d scrap it and we\u2019d do it again. It was tough getting it all to fit together, but when it did it was beautiful.\u201dThe easy route would have been for Code Orange to simply make another record like their 2014 breakthrough, I AM KING. It would have been easy to just enter the studio and churn out the same old thing, but for Code Orange, easy is never an option. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just making records to make records. When you start doing that, you\u2019re everyone else,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re built on not doing the same old shit. When you put on a Code Orange record, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna get. You know it\u2019s gonna be painful, that\u2019s it.\u201dThe contrast between beauty and pain is prevalent throughout FOREVER. The album\u2019s title track is a sludge-fueled nightmare that pummels the listener; it\u2019s Code Orange at their heaviest. Moments later, melody and hints of gracefulness enter with Meyers\u2019 striking vocals on the song \u201cBleeding in the Blur,\u201d only to be ripped away a track later during the electronic hellscape of \u201cThe Mud.\u201d FOREVER is consistent only in its willingness to change and shift.\u201cWe just take it further, but keep it brief,\u201d Morgan stated of the record\u2019s more transcendent moments. Beauty and grace leak through, but are crushed under the weight of the band\u2019s sonic assault.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to keep it painful, because we\u2019re not post. We\u2019re not post anything. We\u2019re current.

Since then they have become one of the most influential underground bands of the past decade, creating a space for sophisticated pop music in the indie world.Within the vibrant community surrounding Arbutus Records at the time of their formation, TOPS forged a unique sound. The only traditional \u2018band\u2019 on the label\u2019s roster, they\u2019ve built a significant following of fans, a dedicated audience at their live shows and a musical connection that continues to deepen as the years go by. With their newly minted label - Musique TOPS -\u00a0the band is poised to release their best work to date.Their tendency to opt towards making straight-forward, stripped down and honest recordings lets their pop songwriting shine out in the open. With a heart firmly attached to their sleeves, their songcraft delves into the emotional intricacy of personal relationships, asking questions about power and desire. Riley Fleck\u2019s measured drumming and David Carriere\u2019s trademark guitar licks mesh with Marta Cikojevic\u2019s lush keyboards. All these elements work in tandem and in service of Jane Penny\u2019s unmistakable, wistful voice.The result of this mixture is a collection of three self-produced records and a handful of singles that cover a range of moods and a complex emotional realm while maintaining a groove and musicality. Soft rock infused pop hits flow easily, surrounded by their signature moody ballads.TOPS are celebrating the launch of their own record label, Musique TOPS, by sharing two unreleased songs, taken from the recording sessions of the band\u2019s most recent LP, Sugar at the Gate. The haunted 70\u2019s folk elegance of \u201cEcho of Dawn\u201d is paired with the energetic \u201cVII Minutes\u201d, a classic example of the band\u2019s uptempo, breezy sound.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"16.00","highPrice":"18.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/tops-mohawk-tickets-74517440671","validFrom":"2019-10-25T10:00:00-05:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"TOPS"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Honey Harper"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Zettajoule"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Kevin Morby -

A lush and dazzling head-trip,\u00a0Pang\u00a0has captured the hearts of a fast-growing audience of romantic pop devotees since it\u2019s October 2019 release. Known equally for her exhilarating live vocal performances, Caroline is bringing\u00a0Pang\u00a0in it\u2019s full surrealist-goth theatricality to select cities and festivals throughout 2020.Polachek has already lived an extraordinary life in music. Her previous band, Chairlift, formed in 2006 while Caroline was in art school in New York City, and her idiosyncratic vocal style and synth textures quickly became their sonic trademark, which continued to evolve through their three critically acclaimed albums.Caroline expanded into production in 2013, landing her first credit writing and producing on Beyonce&#039;s Grammy-nominated self-titled album. Restless while making Chairlift&#039;s third (and final) record\u00a0Moth, Caroline quietly fostered two side projects: baroque girl-group Ramona Lisa, and minimal synth project CEP. Moving fluidly through radically different genres, Caroline collaborated with dozens of artists (Blood Orange, SBTRKT, Charli XCX); sometimes writing, sometimes singing, sometimes directing videos, and sometimes all three.Chairlift disbanded in 2017 and Caroline feverishly began writing for her first solo project under her own name. For the first time, the DNA of these previous projects fused; the playfulness of Chairlift, the psych-classicism of Ramona Lisa, the futuristic glimmerings of CEP, plus a newfound mastery of her voice.Fast forward two years spent manically between the studio and navigating a series of intense personal crossroads, and\u00a0Pang\u00a0is decidedly the most ambitious, hardcore and beautiful record of her career to date. With her signature &#039;organic autotune&#039; and liquid lyricism center stage,\u00a0Pang\u00a0positions her firmly as one of the most singular and captivating singer-songwriters of a generation.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"17.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/caroline-polachek-mohawk-tickets-83067219289","validFrom":"2019-12-11T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Caroline Polachek"},{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Christelle Bofale"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Surf Curse @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F84724195%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191216-183104?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=74a25c824adb892f7c9d27a0c724b95f","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/surf-curse-mohawk-86249682121\/","startDate":"2020-04-24T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-24T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-25T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Surf Curse is the indie rock recording project of Los Angeles based songwriters Nick Rattigan and Jacob Rubeck.

Growing up on the \u2018Rez\u2019, close to a predominantly white town, the two faced similar challenges, but ultimately found refuge in Hip-hop and inspiration in each other\u2019s talents. Snotty Nose Rez Kids (SNRK) was born in 2016, forged from a life-long friendship between two emcees that used music to create, connect with their culture and language, and as an outlet to express themselves.SNRK released two albums in 2017, the first a self-titled project, and the second, The Average Savage, just nine months later. Both solid projects by a new group, The Average Savage gained unlikely notoriety for a small release. The Average Savage resulted in SNRK winning Best Hip Hop Act at the Western Canadian Music Awards (WCMA), landed them on the coveted Polaris Prize Top-ten Shortlist, and received a nomination for Best Indigenous Music Album from theJuno\u2019s. Rising popularity prepared them for their strongest release in 2019, TRAPLINE, which centred their nation, The Haisla Nation, Haisla teachings, the matriarchs in their lives, and created a bridge to other marginalized experiences, tapping The Sorority, Cartel Madras, Brevner, Boslen, and Kimmortal all for features. TRAPLINE has been streamed over 3million times, it\u2019s music videos, viewed over 800,000 times, and it\u2019s constant radio play kept it on the EarshotTop 10 Hip-Hop charts for over 20 weeks. The album was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize, making SNRK one of only 3 artists to ever be shortlisted in back-to- back years. Amidst it\u2019s success, the duo was recognized as Breakout Artist of 2019 at the WCMA\u2019s.Having spent over two years perfecting their live show, SNRK embarked on an ambitions tour in 2019 with over 80 dates across Canada, Australia, Mexico, US, UK and Netherlands. Their Canadian headline tour was a success selling out across the country, and they were headliner or surprise hit of multiple festivals, sharing stages with Method Man &amp; Red Man, Ice Cube, and Cypress Hill. Best described as thought-provoking club bangers, SNRK\u2019s live performance has unparalleled energy and audiences will dance and sweat, but they\u2019ll leave with new knowledge.Preparing for 2020, SNRK are back in the studio writing new music, working on new collaborations with artists in multiple genres, and further developing their craft. They are looking forward to taking their artistry to new heights and into new parts of the world this year.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"10.00","highPrice":"13.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/snotty-nose-rez-kids-mohawk-indoor-tickets-92286035015","validFrom":"2020-02-07T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Snotty Nose Rez Kids"}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Lilly Hiatt @ Mohawk (Indoor)","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F86967865%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20200109-170903?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=4ac9448b320cccbfeea842ba33c2009b","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/lilly-hiatt-mohawk-indoor--73296556975\/","startDate":"2020-04-25T20:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-04-26T06:00:00-05:00","description":"Written during a winter of deep stillness and self-reflection, Lilly Hiatt\u2019s striking new album,\u2018Walking Proof,\u2019 artfully balances the songwriter\u2019s rough, rock and roll exterior with her tender,country roots, exuding a bold vulnerability as she takes a long, hard look in the mirror and deconstructs her relationship with herself and the world around her. Produced by former Cagethe Elephant guitarist Lincoln Parish and featuring guest appearances from Amanda Shires,Aaron Lee Tasjan, and legendary songwriter John Hiatt (who appears on record with his    daughter here for the very first time), the collection is fueled by longing and gratitude in equal measure, effortlessly shifting from gentle intimacy to brawny grit and back over the course of its eleven insightful tracks. Despite all the weighty themes, \u2018Walking Proof\u2019 still manages to emerge as a work of hope and optimism, offering both a newfound maturity and an abiding sense of calm in the face of chaos as Hiatt learns to make peace with just how much of life lies beyond her control.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to live and let live, to be able to accept things for what they are,\u201d says Hiatt.\u201cComing to terms with those sorts of boundaries has inspired a lot of growth in me lately, and I\u2019ve realized that it leads to better outcomes both in relationships and in art.

The band came together several years ago as a result of their shared summers working in the capitalist ruins of western Canada\u2019s forests. The seven tracks that came to form Loving\u2019s eponymous debut EP were written and recorded between Victoria and Toronto in the winter of 2015. The humbly-rendered collection of lo-fi psychedelic folk songs found success online and the band amassed an organic fanbase. Thus inspired to continue the project, Jesse and David decamped to Gabriola Island in the spring of 2017 to begin work on new material. There, they set up a recording studio in Jesse and Lucas\u2019 late grandmother\u2019s seaside home and demoed the songs that would form the backbone of If I Am Only My Thoughts.Released on January 31, 2020 on Last Gang Records, If I Am Only My Thoughts is Loving\u2019s first full-length album. With lyrics written by both Jesse and Lucas, the lush, homespun collection of songs was recorded, mixed, and mastered by David in his basement studio in Victoria. To contrast, these songs are balmy and inviting, a series of open-ended questions that circle the many uncertainties of existence. While the production on If I Am Only My Thoughts inspires a sense of ease, it is deceptively intricate. The underlying tape hiss and handcrafted aesthetic heard on Loving is still present, and that lends the album intimacy. Take the instrumental track \u201cJanuary,\u201d which sounds like a harsh winter\u2019s day spent in front of a fireplace as a crystalline piano is warmed by a string arrangement written and played by collaborator Colin Nealis. If I Am Only My Thoughts offers listeners a space to ruminate on life\u2019s uncertainties and acknowledge the often strange journey of being alive. That sentiment is relayed perfectly on the title track: \u201cAdrift like light upon a riverbed, I\u2019m going somewhere I imagine\/ At least in my head, in my head, in my head.\u201dJapanese city pop, Brazilian boogie, and the songs his parents sang karaoke to, these influences help make Michael Seyer one of the most unique artists creating music in the indie-pop space today. On his new EP Nostalgia the 24 year old songwriter, born in the Philippines but raised in Gardena, a suburb of Los Angeles, set out to create songs which were both fresh and timeless.Michael Seyer developed his songwriting in the SoCal bedroom pop scene and across two self-released full-length records, 2016\u2019s Ugly Boy and 2018\u2019s Bad Bonez. Now, working with Caroline, Seyer looked to his past for inspiration. The six track EP bares the unmistakable hallmarks of classic pop from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s \u2013 the kinds of songs which strove to find a perfect balance between emotion and technique.\u00a0Standouts from the EP include the 80\u2019s pop of \u201cI Can\u2019t Dance,\u201d the saxophone filled bossa nova of \u201cHeaven Only Knows,\u201d and the smooth jazz of \u201cOh! This is Love.\u201d These are the sounds the next generation of parents will want to sing in their living rooms","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"15.00","highPrice":"15.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/loving-michael-seyer-mohawk-indoor-tickets-94728763281","validFrom":"2020-02-28T12:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"The Mountain Goats - SOLD OUT @ Mohawk","image":"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F82842615%2F201097344136%2F1%2Foriginal.20191127-165537?auto=format%2Ccompress&#038;q=75&#038;sharp=10&#038;s=7e44427fd8f17c1359badc6e6109482c","url":"https:\/\/www.mohawkaustin.com\/e\/the-mountain-goats-sold-out-mohawk-74213977003\/","startDate":"2020-05-01T19:00:00-05:00","doorTime":"2020-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","endDate":"2020-05-02T06:00:00-05:00","description":"THE MOUNTAIN GOATS ARE JOHN DARNIELLE, PETER HUGHES, JON WURSTER, AND MATT DOUGLAS.

Founded in 2013, the band has experienced steady growth over the past few years and has been building buzz on the strength of its live shows and the instant connection its music makes with new listeners. The group&#039;s music is best described as &quot;organic electronica&quot;;, using skillful playing, live loops, and tightly constructed songs combined with raw improvisation to build high-energy and uplifting music from scratch, where every note is played and recorded live. The band draws on influences from a wide spectrum of electronica, such as house, drum and bass, and breakbeat, along with elements of jam, funk, and jazz. The result is a live show that is musically sophisticated but widely accessible, with a diverse and engaged fanbase that travels to out of town shows and festivals to witness the band&#039;s continually evolving sound.Yak Attack has been selling out local and regional shows and has developed a reputation as &quot;the region&#039;s go to late night act&quot; in the summer festival and afterparty circuit. They spent the early part of 2019 touring in support of live electronic heavyweights STS9 and Sunsquabi, the band has also shared the stage with emerging acts such as Fruition, Turkuaz, TAUK, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, and The Magic Beans. After releasing &quot;Safety Third&quot; on Ropeadope records in 2018, the band is currently recording their fourth full-length album, while making their debut at national events such as Camp Bisco and Jazzfest, and many new cities across the country on their US fall tour. Watch for Yak Attack to bring its unique dance party to a venue near you.","typicalAgeRange":"all_ages","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mohawk (Indoor)","sameAs":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"912 Red River Street","addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78701","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","name":"Ticket","category":"primary","lowPrice":"10.00","highPrice":"10.00","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"InStock","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/yak-attack-mohawk-indoor-tickets-96204978681","validFrom":"2020-02-28T10:00:00-06:00"},"performer":[{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Yak Attack"}]}]</script><script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.ticketfly.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/core.min.js?ver=1.11.4'></script>
